# Architecture Decision Record: Graph-Enhanced RAG System

## ADR-001: Graph-Enhanced RAG System Architecture

**Status:** Proposed  
**Date:** 2025-08-XX  
**Authors:** [Your Name]  
**Reviewers:** [Team Lead, Senior Engineer]

## Context

We are building an AI support assistant that combines Neo4j knowledge graphs with embeddings and LLM integration to answer technical support questions. The system must provide fast responses (millisecond to one second range) even when dealing with potentially billions of nodes and edges in the knowledge graph.

### Requirements
- Sub-second response times for common queries
- Semantic search capability using embeddings
- Multi-hop graph traversal for context enrichment
- Scalability to billion-node graphs

### Constraints
- Neo4j 5.x infrastructure
- Python runtime environment

## Decision Categories

### 1. Embedding Strategy & Storage

**Decision:** [TO BE DOCUMENTED]

**Context:** Need to balance embedding model performance, latency, and storage efficiency.

**Options Considered:**
- [ ] Option A: Model Name (dimension)
- [ ] Option B: Model Name (dimension) 
- [ ] Option C: Model Name (dimension)
- [ ] Option D: Model Name (dimension)

**Decision Rationale:**
*[Document chosen option and reasoning]*

**Storage Strategy:**
- [ ] Neo4j vector indexes (native support in 5.x)
- [ ] Other
- [ ] Other
- [ ] Other
- [ ] Other
- [ ] Other

**Consequences:**
- Performance impact: [X]ms query latency
- Storage requirements: [X]GB for [Y] vectors
- Cost implications: $[X]/month for embedding API calls
- Maintenance complexity: [Low/Medium/High]

### 2. Model Selection & Fine-tuning

**Decision:** [TO BE DOCUMENTED]

**Context:** Balance between model capability, latency, and cost for embedding generation.

**Embedding Model Selection:**
- **Model:** [Selected model]
- **Rationale:** [Why this model was chosen]
- **Alternatives Rejected:** [Other models considered and why rejected]

**Fine-tuning Strategy:**
- [ ] Use pre-trained models as-is
- [ ] Other
- [ ] Other
- [ ] Other
- [ ] Other

**Performance Benchmarks:**
- Embedding generation: [X]ms per query
- Similarity search: [X]ms for [Y] candidates
- Memory footprint: [X]MB per model instance

**Consequences:**
- Trade-offs between accuracy and speed
- Model update and versioning strategy needed
- Resource requirements for inference

### 3. LLM Integration Decisions

**Decision:** [TO BE DOCUMENTED]

**Context:** Choose LLM provider and integration pattern for response generation.

**LLM Provider Options:**
- [ ] Option A: Model Name/Provider
- [ ] Option B: Model Name/Provider 
- [ ] Option C: Model Name/Provider
- [ ] Option D: Model Name/Provider

**Integration Pattern:**
- **Chosen Approach:** [Selected pattern]
- **Prompt Engineering Strategy:** [Template-based/Dynamic/Hybrid]
- **Context Window Management:** [Truncation/Summarization/Chunking]

**Fallback Strategy:**
- Primary LLM failure handling
- Rate limiting and quota management
- Graceful degradation to cached responses

**Consequences:**
- Response quality vs. latency trade-off
- Cost per query: $[X]
- Vendor lock-in considerations
- Compliance and data privacy implications

**Decision:** [TO BE DOCUMENTED]

**Context:** Design system architecture for fast/slow path routing and scalability.

**Architecture Pattern:**
- [ ] Option A
- [ ] Option B
- [ ] Option C
- [ ] Option D

**Data Flow:**
```
Query → Embedding → Response Generation
```

**Scalability Decisions:**
- 

**Consequences:**
